## OOP basic

What is OOP ?

Object-oriented programming is a style of programming – not a tool – which is why even though it’s an older style. As before we have Procedure-oriented programming or Module-oriented programming, then now almost everyone have used OOP to make software. In Procedure-oriented programming we programmed with procedure-oriented that seperate into functions to handle the problems. Now with Object-oriented programming we seperate into object to handle the problems.

Each object is defined by its own set of properties, which can then be accessed and modified through various oerations.
