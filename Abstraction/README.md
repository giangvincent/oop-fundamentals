# Abstraction

This can be thought of as a natural extension of encapsulation. In Object-oriented design, programs are often extremely large. And seperate objects communicate with each other a lot. So maintaining a large codebase like this for years – with changes along the way- is difficult. Abstraction is a concept aiming to ease this problem. Applying abstraction means that each object should only expose a high-level mechanism for using it. This mechanism should hide internal implementation details. It should only reveal operations relevant for other objects. Think – a coffee machine. It does a lot of stuff and makes quirky noises under the hood. But all you have to do is put in coffe and press a button. Preferably, this mechanism should be easy to use and should rarely change over time. Think of it as a small set of public methods which any other class can call without “knowing” how they work.
